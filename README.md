If you're looking to elevate your business, hire me as your business strategist. I'll position your business at the top of the market.
Hi, this is Umer Habib. I have a bachelor's degree in business and currently live in Europe. Since childhood, I have been fascinated by articles about business in Brussels and the United States. Whenever I see a Mercedes-Benz, I think about the immense effort behind its creation: from concept development, assembling a team, to marketing and profit margins. I wondered how such accomplishments were possible.

I started gaining practical experience by working at my father's bicycle business. I realized that selling is an art that involves effectively communicating business strategies to customers. Mastering this art is crucial for success and wealth. However, it all starts with the basics. You can't expect to become a millionaire overnight; it takes time, quality, marketing, and strategic investment.

Later, I worked at the Maritime Hotel in Bulgaria, where I learned that location and timing are critical for business success. For example, opening a spa club and restaurant near a beach with music can lead to significant success. 

I also observed the market in Brussels, where many high-profile political figures reside. Starting a property business there is strategic, as numerous meetings arranged by the European Parliament bring politicians and parliamentarians who are potential customers. 

Through these experiences and by reading extensively about political and economic issues, I have developed a deep understanding of business strategies in Europe and the United States.
